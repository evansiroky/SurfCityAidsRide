    h3 Santa Cruz AIDS Project
    p The Santa Cruz AIDS Project (SCAP) serves men, women and children who are HIV positive living in Santa Cruz County. Our mission is to promote and participate in a comprehensive and compassionate response to HIV and AIDS through education, advocacy, and supportive services.
    p Your support helps us provide direct services to people in Santa Cruz County living with HIV, such as benefits counseling, housing support, our food pantry, and wellness services.  We help the most vulnerable members of our community live more fulfilling lives.

    h3 Fundraising Expectations
    p All riders are asked to fundraise $300-$500 per individual as part of a team with 5-25 members.  Riders that fundraise between $300 - $500 will receive a free T-shirt and riders that fundraise over $500 will receive a free jersey.
    p.text-danger Starting this year, we are now charging fundraisers the registration fee instead of allowing the fundraising to cover registration.  Registration fees will count towards fundraising goals.
